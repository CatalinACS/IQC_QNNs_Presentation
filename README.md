# IQC_QNNs_Presentation
This repository provides the materials used for the presentation of **Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)**, which was held by me during the **_Introduction to Quantum Computing_** course from POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest.

The code for running Quantum Algorithms is stored [here](https://github.com/CatalinACS/IQC-Lab)
